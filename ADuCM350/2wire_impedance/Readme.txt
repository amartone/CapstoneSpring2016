This is an example for 2-wire impedance measurement.

After the initialization and calibration steps, 4 DFT measurements
are performed, measuring impedance between the AFE pins:
RCAL1-RCAL2, AFE3-AFE4, AFE4-AFE5, AFE3-AFE5.

The test then calculates the magnitude and phase of the DFT results and
reports the calibrated results for the impedances connected between
AFE3-AFE4, AFE4-AFE5, AFE3-AFE5. 

The example doesn't use floating-point, all the arithmetic is performed using
fixed-point. The fixed-point types and functions defined in CMSIS DSP library
are used  whenever possible. A custom fixed-point type, with 28 integer bits
and 4 fractional bits, is used to store the final results.

The excitation voltage and amplitude, as well as RCAL value, are programmable
through macros. 
Note: there are no checks in the code that the values are within admissible ranges,
which needs to be ensured by the user.

When using the Eval-ADuCM350EBZ board, the  test needs a daughter board attached
to the evaluation board, with the relevant impedances populated. The example will
report zero magnitude and zero phase if an open circuit is measured.

Once the test has finished, it sends a result message string to STDIO;
"PASS" for success and "FAIL" (plus failure message) for failures.

The raw DFT complex results (real and imaginary parts) are also reported
through the UART/STDIO, as well as the final calibrated unknown impedances,
represented in polar coordinates (magnitude and phase). The USE_UART_FOR_DATA 
macro determines whether the results are returned to the UART or STDIO.
To return data is using the UART, set the macro USE_UART_FOR_DATA = 1.
To return data is using STDIO, set the macro USE_UART_FOR_DATA = 0.

For Eval-ADUCM350EBZ boards, the results are returned to the PC/host via the 
UART-on-USB interface on the USB-SWD/UART-EMUZ (Rev.C) board to a listening 
PC based terminal application tuned to the corresponding virtual serial port. 
See the ADuCM350 Device Drivers Getting Started Guide for information on drivers 
and configuring the PC based terminal application.
